* This GitHub repository contains Supplementary Material to our paper series on optimal system design for circular-ranging OCT. 
* The table below provides links to Notebooks corresponding to Part 1 | Signals, Part 2 | Nyquist sampling and Part 3 | Oversampling of the series.
* The links construct self-maintining Jupyter Notebooks (written in Python3) without the need to download/install Jupyter or Python.
* The server (<a href="https://mybinder.org">MyBinder</a>) offers satisfactory speed for the simulations. However, to improve computational speed we recommend downloading a Notebook folder (above) and run the Notebook.ipynb file inside a Jupyter Notebook environment. For this you need to install Jupyter Notebook and Python3. We recommend using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a> that installs both platforms for free.
